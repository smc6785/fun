# ASIC
- Application Sepcific Integrated Circuit

# Design Cycle
- Chip Specification
  - Defines features, 
      microarchitecture, 
      functionalities(HW/SW interface),
      specifications(time, area, power, speed)
  - Design team
    - Generates RTL code
  - Verfication team
    - Generates test bench
- Design Entry/ Functional Verification
  - Functional verfication confirms the functionality and logical behavior 
      of the circuit by simulation on a design entry level.
  - This is the stage where the desgin team and verfication team come into
      the cycle where they generate RTL code using test-benches.
      This is also known as behavioral simulation.
- RTL Block Synthesis/ RTL Fcuntion
  - Once the RTL code and testbench are generated,
      the RTL team works on RTL description, they translate the RTL code
      into a gate-lvel netlist using a logival synthesis tool that meets
      required timing constraints.
      A synthesized database of the ASIC design is created in the system.
      When timming constraints are met with the logical synthesis, the design
      proceeds to the design for testability(DFT) techniques.
- Chip Partitioning
  - This is the stage wherein the engineer follows the ASIC design layout
      requirement and specification to create its structure using EDA
      tools and proven methodologies.
  - The design structure is going to be verified with the help of HLl
      programming languages like C++ ot System C.
- Design for Test(DFT) Insertion
- Floor planning
- Placement
- CLock tree synthesis
- Routing Stage
- Final Verification
