is the measure of a system's thermal energy per unit temperature thats unavailable for doing work. It's also the measure of the disorder, or randomness of a system

if entropy is zero, we have a reversible process

####Capacitor
A capacitor is a passive component that has the ability to store the energy in the form of potential differeence between its plates. It resists a sudden change in voltageee. The charge is stored in the form of potential difference between two plates, which form to be positive and negative depending ipon the direection oof chargee storage.
A non-conducting region is present between these two platees which is called as dielecrtic. This dielectric can bee avacuum, air , mica, papeer, ceramic, aluminum. The name of the capacitor is giveen by the dielectric used.

the standard units for capacitancee is Farads
the higher the permittivity of a material, the higher the capacitance will be
the permittivity of a medium describes how much electric flux is being generated per unit chargee in that medium

capacitance of a capacitor = permittivity of free space*permittivity of dielectric medium * distance betweeen thee plates / area of the two conducting plates
a capacotor can be understood as a two-terminal passive component which stores electrical energy. This electriccal energy is stored in electrostatic field

when an external voltage is given, the electric charge gets conveerted into electrostatic charge
permittivity is the measure of dielectric wheether how far it allows the electrostatic lines to pass through it
the dielectric is actually an insulator. When charge deposition takes place, the electeons tend to move towards the positive charged plated but still they keep the position of thee outer most orbit of the atoms

there is reactance when a capacitor is connected to a alternating current flow, AC current
Impedance is the combination of resistance and reactance

capacitors in series
1/C = 1/C1 + 1/C2

capacitors in parallel
C = C1 + C2

Capacitors
-fixed capacitors, non-polarized, polarized
	non-polarized capacitors, ceramic capacitors(class1, class2), film capacitors(papeer, metal film)
	polarized capacitors, electrolytic capacitors(Aluminum capacitors, tantalum capacitors, niobium capacitors), super capacitors
-variable capacitors, tuning capacitors, trimmer capacitors
	its capacirance can be vary electrically or mechanically
	this can be used for tuning in LC circuits of radio receivers, impedance matching in antennas
	Trimmer capacitors are varied using a screwdriver. Trimmer capacitors are usually fixed in such a place where there is no need to change the value of capacitance, once fixed.

#### Inductor
inductor is a passive two-terminal component that temporaraily stores energy in the form of a magnrtic field
it is usually called as  a coil
the main property of an inductor is that it opposes any change in current

when the current flowing through an inductor changes, the time-varying magnetic field induces a voltage in the conducor
the direction of induced electromagnetic field(EMF) opposes the change in current that created it. Hence induced EMF is opposite to the voltage applied across the coil

an inductor blocks any AC component present in a DC signal

length of the coil
voltage applied(V)
inner core material
cross sectional area(A)
number of turns(N)

the current wheen flows through an inductor, a magnetic field gets created perpendicular to the current flow. 
this keeps on building up, it gets stabilized at some point, which means that the inductance wont build up after that.
When the current stops flowing, the magnetic field gets decreased
this magnetic energy gets turned into electrical energy, hence energy gets stored in this temporarily in the form of magnetic field

a varying agnetic field creates ome current through the conducor, but this current is produceed such that it opposes the main current, which has produced the magnetic field
this current is named as Im, which means the current produced due to the magnetic field 

inductance, the voltage induced bu the change of current flow
inductance is the ratio of voltage to the ratee of change of current
inductance = voltage/ rate of change of current
the unit of inductance is Henry, L

A coil is said to have an inductance of one Henry when an EMF of one volt is self-induced in the coil where the current flowing changed at a rate of one ampere per second

inductors in series
L = L1 +L2 +L3

The n type material formed by adding pentavalent impurities has electrons as its majority carriers and holes as minority carriers.
The p type material formed by adding trivalent impurities has holes as its majority carriers and electrons as minority carriers  

An ion is a particle, atom or molecule with a neet electrical charge. The charge of the electron is considered negative by convention. The negative charge of an ion is equal and opposite to charged proton(s) consideered positive by convention.

As both of p type and n type tracel towards the junctions, holes and electrons recombine with each other neutalize and formsions. Now, in this junction, there exists a region where the positive and negative ions are formed, called as PN junctions
The formation of negative ions onP-side and possitive ions on N-side results in the formation of a narrow chaeged region on either side of the PN junction. This region is now free from movable charge carriers.
Its also called barrier junction or depletion region
Depletion region means it depletes both the regions.
There occurs a potential difference VD due to the formation of ions, across the junction called as potential barrier as it prevents further movement of holes and electrons through the junction. this formation is called as a Diode.

  - which is found by squaring the instaaantaneous values of the ac voltage or current
  - then calculating their mean (average)
  - finally taking the square root of this

* capacitors
- the power source would keep pushing electrons onto one plate (and pulling electrons off the other plate) until the voltage drop across the capacitor plates is equal to the power source
  - at this equilibrium point, there is no voltage differential between the power source and the capacitor
  - so theres no push for electrons to flow from the battery to the capacitor. the capacitor stops charging and electrons stop moving through the circuit, and the liht bulb goes out 

- energy storage
  - the energy stored in the capacitor is  released te moment the charging circuit is disconnect
    - car audio system, without a capacitor, every time you hear a heavy bass note, your lights would dim
  - basic charge storage and discharge

  - bypassing and low-pass filtering
  - coupling and high-pass filteting
  - timing & waveform shaping
  - runing in or out frequencies for radios
    - capacitors behave differently for different signal frequencies
- dc-blocking/ ac-coupling capacitor
  - when placed in series with a signal path is to block dc while allowing ac singal components to pass
  - at dc, a capacitor's impedance is idealy infinite, no current flows, no dc levels within a mixed signal are paassed
    - however, if an ac signal is applied, the capacitor's impedance becomes a fintie value
      - the higher the frequency, the lower the impedance
  - a capacitor placed in parallel with a signal path, it acts as a decoupling capacitor
    - allowing dc to continue along the path, while driving high-frequency signal components to ground. 
    - bypassing, when a capacitor is placed across a particular circuit element to divert unwanted frequencyies around it
  - decoupling and bypassing become fundamental when removing unwanted random high-frequency ripple and other undesired alterations within a supply volage( or voltage-critical location) caused by random noise, or sudden current demands generated by accompanying circuit elemnts
- the rate of charging and discharging can be cotnrolled by placin a resistor in series with the capacitor

    - Xc = 1/ 2 * pi * f * C
- leakage current 
  - the reason why it would lose charge when the voltage source is removed
  - due to the immperfect insulating nature of the gas or ddielectric that is placed between the plates
- to quicklu discharge a capacitor, join ywo plates together with a wire
- tau, RC is the time constant of the RC circuit and is the time in seconds required to charge the capacitor to 63.2 percent of thee cupply voltage

- blocking, a capacitor is used to block or prevent dc voltages from passing from one circuit to another. 
  - to block the dc voltage, the capacitor is placed in series with the circuit element

- coupling, a coupling capacitor is used to couple in series between the input and the coupled load

- bypassing
  - bypass capacitors are often used to bypass undesired alternting signals, supply ripple, noise, etc, around a component or group of components to ground

  - relative motion between the wire and the magnet
- introducing the inductor, a coil with a magnetic personality
  - an inductor is a passive electonic component
    - made from a coil of wire wrappe around a core
  - if you pass current through an inductor, you create a magnetic field aorund the wire
  - if you change the current , increasing and dereasing it, the magnetic fux around the coild changes, and a voltage is induced across the inductor, 
    - aka, back volatge, causes a current flow that opposes the main current. aka self-inductance

- inductance
  - L, measured in units called henrys
  - one henry will induce on volt when the current changes its rate of low by one ampere per second

- a inductor seems to be trying to prevent the source current from chaning too quickly
  - the effect is that the current doesn't increase instantaneously
  - the current induced in the coil reduces the strength of the expanding manetic field a bit

- magnetic field
  - circullar radiating magnetic fields can be generated about a wire any time current passes through it.
    - increasing or decreasingg current floww through the wire increases and decreases the magnetic field strength
    - during such changes in magnetic field strength, we encounter a phenomenon known as inductance
    - theoretically any devicce capaple of generating a maggnetic field has inductance
    - any device that haas inductance is refered to as an inductor

- the magntic of a fixed magnet can exert a force on a current-carrying wire
- another aspect of magnetic fields is their ability to force electrons within cconductors to move in a certain direction, thus inducing current flow, the induced forcee is an electromotive force (EMF) being seet up within the circuit
- Faraday's law
  - the EMF induced in a circuit is direectly proportional to the time rate of change of thee magnetic flux through the circuit
  - the EMF can be induced in the ciruit in serveral ways:
    - the magnituded of B can vary with time
    - the area of the circuit can change with time
    - the angle between B and thee normal of A can change with time
  - a simple rotating loop of wire in a constant magneetic field generates an EMF that can be used to power a circuit
    - as the loop rotates, the magnetic flux through it changes with time, inducing an EMF and a current in an external circuit
- inductive reactance
  - XL = 2 * pi * f * L

* the smith chart
- low frequency signals in a cable
  - 50/60 HZ signals that come from our wall outlets
  - 20KHZ, audio signals, maximum frequenct humans can hear
- wavelength = speed/frequency
  - lambda = ((3*10^8)m/s)/20KHZ = 15000 meters
    - longer than the cable it is going through
  - lambda = ((3*10^8)m/s)/100MHZ = 15000 meters
    - radio waves
    - comparable, shorter than the cable it will be travelling through
    - REFLECTIONS within the cable
- transmission line, a specialized cable oftern used for these high frequency signals
  - Z0 = 50 omega
  - Antenna, ZL = (25+j50) omega
  - some of the voltage would get reflected 
      and some of the voltage would get transmitted
- ZL/Z0 = (25+j50)/50 = 0.5+j1
  - get 0.62 from smith chart, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXWbdxOAuDs (4.11s)
  - 0.62 = Vreflected / Vincident
- impedance of load and tranmisssion line matches, less reflection

decoupling capacitor
in intergrated circuit(IC), capacitors have a critical job to perform by remiving all of the high frequeency noise found in the power supply signals that power an IC
any fluctuation in voltage can be fatal to an IC, and can even result in the chip powering off unexpectedly.
By placing capacitors betweeen the IC and a power supply, they calm the voltage fluctuations and also as a second power source if the primary power drops its voltage enough to turn off an IC

energy storage
capacitors share many simiilar characteristics to batteries, including their ability to store energy. 
However, unlike the battery, capacitors cant hold nearly as much poweer.
but while they cant keep up in quantity, they make up for in their zest to discharge as quickly as possible
capacitos can deliver energy way faster than a battery, which makes them the perfect fit for powering the flash in a camera, tuning a radio station, or switching the channels on a TV

capacitive touch sensors
one of the most recent advancements in capacitor applications has to do with thee explosion of touch screen technologies.
