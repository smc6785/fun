OEM, original equipment manufacturers
  - produces some original equipments
  - their forus is on degisning, promoting, assembling cars and odering from vendors

Tier 1, 2 and 3 suppliers
- Tier 1 suppliers are companies that supply parts or systems directly to OEMs
  - Tire 1 usualy work with a variety of car companies
- Tier 2, supply parts that end up in carss, they dont directly sell to OEMs.
  - they dont have the ability or desire to produce automotive-grade parts
- Tier 3, rare, raw, close to raw materials, plasti or metal

ECU, electronic control unit includes sensors, actuators, microcontrollers
CAN network
 
Microcontroller Abstraction Layer, MCAL
  makes the BSW (basic software) 
  and the application layer 
  independent of the microcontroller

- application layer
- runtime environent
- basic software
  - services layer
    - system
    - memory
    - communication
    - crypto
  - ECU abstraction layer
    - system abstraction 
    - memory abstraction 
    - communication abstraction 
    - crypto abstraction 
  - microcontrolleer abstractioin layer
  - complex drivers layer
- microcontroller

BSW modules:
- operating system
- access to non volatile memory
- communicatioin via CAN, LIN, FlexRay and Ethernet
- handling the diagnostics
- access to I/O ports
- systems services like ECU state management

MCAL, microcontrolleer abstractioin layer
- SW modules with direct access to the uC and internal peripherals
- make higher SSW layers independent of uC
- implementation: uC dependent
  upper interface: standardized and uC independent

ECU abstraction layer
- interfaces the microcontrolleer abstractioin layer
- implementationl: uC independent, ECU hardware dependent
   Uper interfacae: uC and ECU hardware independent

Complex drivers layer

Services layer, mostly uC and ECU hardware independent

RTE, AUTOSAR runtime environment
- is a layer providing communication services to the application software, AUTOSAR SW components and/or AUTOSAR sensor/actuator components
- make AUTOSAR SW components independent from the mapping to a specific ECU
- implementation: ECU and application specific (geneerated individually for each ECU)
  upper interface: completely ECU independent

Application layer, OEM would pay for this

================
legacy CAN STACK architecture

Application
CAN STACK
CAN DRIVER, hardware API
CAN HAREWARE

================
AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture
- application layer
- runtime environment, RTE
- basic software, BSW
- microconroller
