# USB endpoint
- An endpoint is a buffer on a USB device
- The host can send and receive data to or from that buffer.
- Endpoints can be cateforized into control and data endpoints
  - Control transfers, endpoint0, bi-directional
  - Interrupt transfers, polling rate
  - Isochronous transfers, transmitting real-time information such as audio and video data
  - Bulk transfers, interrupt transfers, but no defined polling rate
    - bulk write and bulk read to endpoints
