radio frequency sifnals
use radio wave to transmit or reveice information
radio frequency sifnals are made of electric and magnetic waves, eeelectromagnetic waves
the two waves or fields vary in intensity over time forming two separate but related waves
whenever the electric wave is oriented vertically, the magnetic wave is oriented horizontally
because the electromagnetic waves have a distinct orientation, they are said to be polarized
the polarity of an RF signal can be horizontal, vertical, or even circular

RF is said to radiate and is referred to as electromagnetic radiation, but unlike nuclear radiation which is harmful
radio waves are non ionizing, the energy they contain is at a much lower level and is not capable of ionizing atoms which is what makes nuclear radiation dangerous

how quickly the electric and magnetic fields vary in intensity or oscillate determines their frequency
if a wave passes through a complete cycle 100,000 times per second , then its frequency is said to be 100,00 hertz
radio waves travels at the speed of light and the distance during one complete cycle determines the wave length of the RF singal
lower frequency = longer wavelength
higher frequency = shorter wavelength
wavelength = speed of light / frequency
299,792,458 / 870,000 = 345 meters, means the wavelength of a 870KHZ RF signal
lambda, symbol for wavelength

antennas emit and/or absord radio waves
omni antenna
directional antenna

RF can travel through many environments, air, the vacuum of space, walls
they just dont travel well through very dense materials such as concrete water dirt or metal

ground waves
radio herizon
line of sight
atmosphere conditions affect the way in which radio waves propagate through the air
heavey rain can absorb certain high-frequency radio waves, because their short wavelngths allow them to be absorbed by large rain droplets
the ionosphere affected by the solar winds
path loss, the intensity or signal strength is reduced
in general, lower frequencies travel further than high frequencies
multipath interference

uncertainty principle
- the more samples you take, the more certaiin you can be of the frequencies contained
- but the more samples you take, the less localized in time you are 

superposition principle
x = np.linespace(0, 2*np.pi,100)
y1 = 5* np.sin(x)
y2 = 0* np.sin(2*x)
y3 = 3* np.sin(3*x)

radio devices all around us that are transmitting
they are all getting added togtether and making this really big complex wave
we are able to tune in to one frequency with radio
thats possible, because its able to de convolute this really complicated wave of electromagnetic radiation

the superposition principle is how there can be many different radio signals in the air at the same time

deconvolution is possible
becasue waves of differing frequencies are orthogonal
a convoluted wave (made of multiple frequencies) can be broken into each of its component frequencies
* this can be done with fourier transform
goes from the time domain to the frequency domain

time domain
setuo_graph(title='Ah vowel sound', x_label='time (in seconds)', y_label='amplitude', fig_size=(14,7))
_ = plt.plot(time_array[0:4000], input_signal[0:4000])

frequency domain
fft_out = np.fft.rfft(input_signal)
fft_mag = [np.sqrt(i.real**2 + i.imag**2)/len(fft_out) for i in fft_out]
num_samples = len(input_signal)
rfreqs =[(i*1.0/num_smaples)*sample_rate for i in range(num_samples//2+1)]
setup_graph(tile='FFT of Ah Vowel (first 5000)', x_label='FFT bins', y_label='magnitude'. fig_size=(14,7))
_ = plt.plot(rfreqs[0,5000], fft_mag[0:5000])

deconvolution is basically how we tune into a particular radio frequency

orthogonality of waves of differing frequencies
waves of differing frequencies are orthogonal to one another (dot product is zero)
t =np.linespace(0,1,samp_rate * len_in_sec)
sin_8hz = 1*np.sin(8*2*np.pi*t)
sin_12hz = 1*np.sin(12*2*np.pi*t)
np.dot(sin_8hz, sin_12hz)
* output of the dot product is 2.0790660859582033e-15

whereas, waves of the same(or close) frequencies have larger dot products
t =np.linespace(0,1,samp_rate * len_in_sec)
sin_8hz = 1*np.sin(8*2*np.pi*t)
sin_8_1hz = 1*np.sin(8.1*2*np.pi*t)
np.dot(sin_8hz, sin_8_1hz)
* output of the dot product is 464.37702127330243

Euler's formula relates e^ix = cosx + i*sinx
e^i*pi +1 =0

radio waves are actually transmitted as complex waves, not simple waves
if we want to craft our own radio waves to control thinf, we'll need to use complex sine waves

modems = MOdulator + DEModulator

modulation, manipulating a carrier wave to carry information
- amplitude-shift keying, ASK
- frequency-shift keying, FSK
- phase-shift keying, PSK
- quadrature amplitude modulation, QAM
	essentially, this is a conbination of ASK and PSK
	this is what modern WiFi mostly uses
