# PCIE
- Peripherial Component Interconnect Exoress
- A PCIe lane is a serial connection for data transfer.
  - PCIe x4
  - PCIe x8
  - PCIe x16
- PCIe 1.0, PCIe 2.0, PCIe 4.0 would have different lane speed.

# PCIe Topology
- CPU <-> root complex <-> memory
              |
              v
  PCIe endpoint/switches/repearter/PCIe bridage

- In root complex
  - CPU <-> Bridge <- primary bus -> PCI virtual bridge 
    <-downstram port-> PCIe endpoint
- Endpoint 
  - Reuqester or completer of PCIe transcation.
  - Legacy endpoint
    - Supports PCI transactions to support backward compatability.
  - Native endpoint
    - Does not support the following PCI transactions
      - I/O transactions
      - 32 bit only memory access
      - Locaked tansactions.
- Switch
  - Logical assembly of multiple virtual PCI to PCI bridge devices.
  - Upstream port
  - Downstream port
  - PCIexpress, point to point, bus is not shared,
    so switch like topology is required.

- Root complex, an interface between CPU and memory and the reset of the PCIe.
- Repeater, signal conditioner
  - Reimers
  - Redrivers
- Endpoint
- PCIe control signals
  - PERST, fundamental reset.
  - WAKE
  - CLKREQ
  - REFCLk
  - RX detect
  - PCIe x8
  - Polling, link training 
  - Configuration
  - PCIe link equalization, presets.

- A PCIe controller will be integrated to the SOC.
  And connected to internal bus/NOC.

# PCIe Initialization
- Druing hardware initialization, each PCIe link is setup following a
  negotiation of lane width and frequency of operation.
- No firmware or OS required.
# PCIe Link
- Link sonsists of dual undirectional differential signal.
  Can be of 1,2,4,8,12,16,32 lanes.
- A data clock is embedded using an encoding scheme.
# PCIe Lane
- Set of differential signal pair
- One pair for transmission, one pair for receiver.
# Differential signaling
- Method for electrically transmitting information
  using two complementry signals.
- Noise immunity.

# PCIe Controller
- Each layer has Tx and Rx.
- Transaction layer
  - Transaction layer packets, TLPs.
- Data link layer
  - Middle layer, does link management, data integrity, error detection
    and correction.
- Physical layer
  - Contains all circuitory for interface
    - Driver and input buffer.
    - Parallel to serial and serial to paralled.
    - PLL, Impedance matching circuitry.
    - Encode/decoder, scrambller/descrambller.
  - Logical sub block.
  - Electrical sub block.
  - Differential analog signaling increases noise immunity.
  - Differential analog signaling decreases electomagnetic interface(EMI)
    since the return current is flowing in th e2nd signal trace.
  - Data scrambling spreads RF energy, resulting in less EMI.
  - Link training
    - Both peers negotiate
- Address mode:
  - Memory.
  - I/O
  - Configuration
  - Message, like power management related transcation and interrupts.

- Data is transmitted in form of packets.
